        "In this assignment, you will:\n",
        "- Load the Airbnb dataset you cleaned in Assignment 6\n",
        "- Apply data transformation techniques like scaling, binning, encoding, and feature creation\n",
        "- Make the dataset easier to use for tasks like pricing analysis, guest segmentation, or listing recommendations\n",
        "- Practice writing up your analysis clearly so a business audience — like a host, marketing manager, or city partner — could understand it\n",

        "## Why This Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "Airbnb analysts, hosts, and city partners rely on clean and well-structured data to make smart decisions. Whether they’re adjusting prices, identifying high-performing listings, or designing better guest experiences, they need data that’s transformed, organized, and ready for use.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Each row represents one property listing. The columns include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Host attributes** (e.g., host ID, host name, host response time)\n",
        "- **Listing details** (e.g., price, room type, minimum nights, availability)\n",
        "- **Location data** (e.g., neighborhood, latitude/longitude)\n",

        "- **Calendar/booking variables** (e.g., last review date, number of reviews)\n",

Airbnb’s data science and analytics teams would benefit most from this transformation because scaled data ensures consistency when feeding variables into predictive models for pricing, demand forecasting, and user behavior. The revenue management team can use normalized values to compare listings across different markets without distortions from differing numeric ranges."

        "1. The transformation step that felt most important was scaling the numeric columns (`minimum_nights` and `number_of_reviews`) using Min-Max and Z-score normalization. This is crucial for many machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of input features.\n",
        "2. The creation of the `price_per_night` and `is_long_stay` columns would be most useful to a host. 'price_per_night' gives them a clear metric to compare their pricing against others on a nightly basis, while 'is_long_stay' helps them understand if their listing attracts longer bookings, which can inform their strategy and amenities offered.\n",
        "3. If I were going to build a tool or dashboard, I would next explore relationships between the transformed features and booking rates or review scores. For instance, I would analyze if listings with \"High\" review volume categories or those flagged as 'is_long_stay' have higher booking rates. I would also look at how 'price_per_night' varies across different 'room_type' categories. This would involve correlation analysis, some basic statistical modeling, and creating visualizations to present the findings clearly.\n",
        "4. This assignment directly relates to my customized learning outcome about applying data transformation techniques to prepare real-world datasets for analysis and visualization. By performing scaling, binning, encoding, and feature creation, I have practiced turning raw data into a format suitable for business intelligence and analytical tasks, which is a key part of my learning objective."
